# Node.js REST API Architecture Setup

This project is a REST API built with Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and MongoDB. It includes a seeder command to populate the database with initial data and is ready for cloud deployment on AWS. The application exposes a set of APIs that can be accessed locally on port 3000.

## Features

- **Node.js**: The backend is built with Node.js (version 20).
- **Express**: A fast and minimal web framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly-typed JavaScript for improved development and maintainability.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing application data.
- **AWS**: Cloud deployment using AWS infrastructure (you can configure deployment to AWS after setting up).
- **Seeder Command**: Command to populate the database with initial data.

## Prerequisites
